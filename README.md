# Remote Teaming Made Easy with mob.sh

This is the repo we'll use at the Software Teaming Online Conference 2024 for the above named session.

There will be a little discussion and background, then we'll do some hands-on remote teaming with the `mob.sh` tool.

We encourage you to participate in the hands-on part of the session, so if that sounds like fun, please be prepared with the following:
- Your favorite IDE with a Python 3.x environment ready to run tests with unittest (we’re on version 3.12).
- Working Git command line environment (we’re on version 2.34.1).
- Latest version of the mob.sh command line tool installed (we’re on version 4.5.0). Find it here: https://mob.sh and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
- Your Github account name, so we can add you to this repo.

Cheers!
